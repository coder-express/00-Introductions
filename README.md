This project will see participants build a social innovation application that helps people put forward ideas that solve local community challenges. Users can then volunteer to become involved in the projects.
### Personal Project
Participants will then design, develop and deploy their own project idea over the last four classes. This will bring together all the learnings and new skills to create a web application that the participant is passionate about.
### Certification and Demo Day
Two weeks after the course, participants will return for a certification event and demonstrate the applications they have built to invited guests.
